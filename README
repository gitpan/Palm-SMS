Palm-SMS version 0.01
=====================

This is Palm::SMS, a Perl module for reading, manipulating, and
writing the .pdb files used by Handspring SMS application on PalmOS
devices such as Handspring Treo 270.

Palm::SMS module is the result of a reverse engineering attempt of
trasforming a Handspring Treo 270 SMS PDB file into a plain text file.
The PDB test file was produced by Handspring's application SMS
v. 3.5H.

Due to lack of knowledge about how PDB files work and what format SMS
database files conform to, at present this module is not suitable for
from-scratch SMS generation.  Conversely, you may find it extremely
useful if you intend to extract SMS messages from merged PDB files and
convert them to a human readable form.

I heard rumors that SMS format changes with GSM network providers.
Please, contact me if this module cannot correctly handle your
messages, hopefully attaching a patch which corrects the shortcoming.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires that at least

  Palm::Raw

is installed on your system.  To be productive, you'll surely want to
have

  Palm::PDB

as well.  Both modules are provided by Andrew Arensburger's p5-Palm
library.


The utility smsdump requires the following modules:

  Getopt::Long
  Pod::Usage
  File::Basename
  Date::Format
  Text::Wrap

which should all be available in a standard Perl installation.


DOCUMENTATION

All documentation is in the form of PODs embedded in the module files
themselves. Use

  pod2text lib/Palm/SMS.pm
  pod2text bin/smsdump
